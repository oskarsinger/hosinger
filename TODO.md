#Linear Algebra

##Decompositions

###QR
* Need to make sure that my inner product space QR decomposition will be numerically stable.
* Need to try to take advantage of block diagonal structure.
    * Should start by feeding in some compact representation of block locations and calling current function as subroutine on each block.

#Data
* Choose either servers or loaders to give option to average over certain coordinates.
