#Ideas for My RL Project

##Applications

* Start looking around at other MIDAS faculty for people who might need this stuff. Maybe even check out non-MIDAS people or people from other schools. Maybe focus on people more on the engineering side to make collaboration easier.

###Telescope Measurements
* Should talk to Paul about the astronomy/telescopes measurement thing. That would be quite an interesting project.

* We could try to determine when/whether to schedule a telescope session, or even where in the sky to measure.

* Potential issues include
    * sparse (or non-existent) data
    * difficult data format like some sort of weird image

###Clinical Stuff
* Keep in touch with Ambuj Tewari and keep looking at Susan Murphy's page.

* The Hulu/Netflix binge-watching data set that Eric mentioned is a really interesting example of addiction behavior.
