#Ideas for My RL Project

##Core ML

###Adaptive Epoch Length
Split the learning into epochs and make the epoch length a function of the data (or the data's heterogeneity model).

####Motivation

####Approach

###Adaptive Regularization
Make the regularization constants a function of the data (or the data's heterogeneity model).

####Motivation

####Approach

###Heterogeneous Population Model
Attempt to account for different subgroups of the population in a data-dependent manner.

##Applications

* Look around for people in other fields who are interested in or already using RL. Places to start:
    * MIDAS faculty
    * Engineering faculty
    * Natural science faculty

* Laura pointed me to the [UCI ML Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html), which has a ton of cool data sets. Looking at the time series data sets to see if we can work with any of them.

###Telescope Measurements
* Should talk to Paul about the astronomy/telescopes measurement thing. That would be quite an interesting project.

* We could try to determine when/whether to schedule a telescope session, or even where in the sky to take measurements.

* Potential issues include
    * sparse (or non-existent) data on measurement days
    * difficult data format like some sort of weird image

###Clinical Stuff
* Keep in touch with Ambuj Tewari and keep looking at Susan Murphy's page, especially since Ambuj said they'd be teaching that RL-for-health course next year.

* The Hulu/Netflix binge-watching data set that Eric mentioned is a really interesting example of addiction behavior. Feels a little sinister, though. Step carefully.
